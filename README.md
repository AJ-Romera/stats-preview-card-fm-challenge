## Overview

### The challenge

This is a challenge from [FrontendMentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/stats-preview-card-component-8JqbgoU62). (This is the web if you want to take the challenge or other frontend good challenges)

It consists on building out a card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible, using any tool I like. It has to be responsive (at least mobile and desktop)
